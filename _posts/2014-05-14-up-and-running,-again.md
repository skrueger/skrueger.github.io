<h2 class="post-title">Up and running, again</h2>
<p class="post-meta">Wednesday, May 14th 2014</p>
<p>Apparently this site has been down for over a year. The amazon EC2 instance that was running the server was shut down since February 2013. I restarted it with no problems and had the public key to login still on my box with putty configured properly.  Everything seems to be working pretty well. I got inspired to work on this again from watching a plural insight video. I will making more posts and start growing this site. I first need a better way to edit its content. I am not going to use wordpress or any other CMS. I'll come up with my own system that works well. Maybe just edit locally + SCP. We'll see.</p>
