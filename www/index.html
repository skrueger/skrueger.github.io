            <p class="post-meta">Friday, July 11th 2014</p>
            <p>The event I've been waiting for all year is finally here! The Seattle to Portland (STP) bike ride is tomorrow! STP is a huge 200 mile bike ride that starts in Seattle on the University of Washington campus and ends in Downtown Portland.  10,000 bike riders participate each year.  Riders complete the ride in one or two days. Two day riders stop at a half way point to sleep for the night in a tent or in a hotel.  Last year, I did the event in two days. This year, I am doing it in one.</p>

            <p class="text-center small">Route and stops</p>
            <p>I will be getting up at 3:30 AM tomorrow to meet my friends at the starting line at 4:30 AM.  I have 3 alarms set to make sure I get up on time.  I have all my stuff packed and laid out on my kitchen table. It is all ready for me to go.</p>

            <p>I'll be riding in my Cannondale CAAD8 I got bike in 2010 when I was an intern.  My friend just tuned it up and put new handle bar wrappings on it.  I'm excited to see how it feels tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Each year they give out a little gift to the riders.  The past few years they gave out a light biking jacket with that year's STP design on it.  This year they are giving away a very nice multipurpose tool with the 2014 STP logo on one side and the Cascade Bicycle Club logo on the other.  This is tool looks very nice.  I talked to another friend and he likes this a lot. He never worry his jackets he received in previous years.  The one I last year is too small for me.  They ran out of my size before I picked mine up.</p>

            <p>I hope I do well tomorrow.  I've never rode 200 miles in a day before.  I am prepared.  I have been training.  The past few weeks I've been biking about 100+ miles each week.  I've been saying do or die to my friends over the past few weeks.  I have a good group of friends to ride with and my friend's wife will be riding along for support in case anything happens.</p>
            <p>Wish me luck!  I'll let you know how it turns out.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title">Always URL encode your Base64 encoded query parameters</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">Thursday, July 10th 2014</p>
            <blockquote><p>"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."</p><p><small>Thomas A. Edison</small></p></blockquote>
            <p>I spent a large portion of the day at work debugging an issue where I did not URL encode a Base64 encoded value I was sending to a server as a query parameter value.  I want to make sure I never waste time on this issue again.  I am writing a basic explanation of the problem and how to avoid it as reminder to myself.  I hope this may help some one else in the future too.</p>
            <p>Base64 encoded strings can contain the <code>+</code> character. If the <code>+</code> character is placed on a URL query parameter, it is interpreted as a space.  This is problematic because a space (<code> </code>) character is NOT a <code>+</code>. In fact, the space (<code> </code>) character is <b>not</b> a valid Base64 encoding character.</p>
            <p>To circumvent this behavior make sure you URL encode the Base64 encoded value so that <code>+</code> characters are encoded as <code>%2B</code>.</p>
            <p>For example, say I have to send <code>QUJD+REVG+0hJY=</code> to a server. If I put this on a URL <i>without</i> URL encoding the value, the URL will look like this: <code>http://simonkrueger.com?q=QUJD+REVG+0hJY=</code>. This URL is perfectly valid, but when a request with this URL is sent to a server the query parameter, <code>q</code>, is seen with a value of <code>QUJD REVG 0hJY=</code>. This is <i>not</i> what I wanted. Do you <i>see</i> those spaces? </p>
            <p>To fix this, I can URL encode this value <i>before</i> it is put on the URL. The URL now looks like this: <code>http://simonkrueger.com?q=QUJD%2BREVG%2B0hJY=</code>. Now the server sees <code>q</code>'s value as <code>QUJD+REVG+0hJY=</code>. Exactly what I wanted :).</p>
            <p>This is a pretty simple mistake that I am sure has been made a million times. I hope to not to make it a million and one. Anyway, always URL encode your <s>Base64 encoded</s> query parameters!</p>

            <h2 class="post-title">Bootstrapped</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">Saturday, June 28th 2014</p>
            <p>I've updated the site's design today. I used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> to do most of the work. I've been in love with bootstrap ever since I learned about it a month ago. It provides tons of CSS components to easily arrange a website. It is so easy, part of me feels like I am cheating. If you haven't heard of it I highly recommend you check it out. It makes web site construction a joy.</p>

            <p class="post-meta">Wednesday, May 14th 2014</p>
            <p>Apparently this site has been down for over a year. The amazon EC2 instance that was running the server was shut down since February 2013. I restarted it with no problems and had the public key to login still on my box with putty configured properly.  Everything seems to be working pretty well. I got inspired to work on this again from watching a plural insight video. I will making more posts and start growing this site. I first need a better way to edit its content. I am not going to use wordpress or any other CMS. I'll come up with my own system that works well. Maybe just edit locally + SCP. We'll see.</p>
