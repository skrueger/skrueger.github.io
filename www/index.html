            <p>I've updated the site's design today. I used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> to do most of the work. I've been in love with bootstrap ever since I learned about it a month ago. It provides tons of CSS components to easily arrange a website. It is so easy, part of me feels like I am cheating. If you haven't heard of it I highly recommend you check it out. It makes web site construction a joy.</p>

            <p>Apparently this site has been down for over a year. The amazon EC2 instance that was running the server was shut down since February 2013. I restarted it with no problems and had the public key to login still on my box with putty configured properly.  Everything seems to be working pretty well. I got inspired to work on this again from watching a plural insight video. I will making more posts and start growing this site. I first need a better way to edit its content. I am not going to use wordpress or any other CMS. I'll come up with my own system that works well. Maybe just edit locally + SCP. We'll see.</p>
