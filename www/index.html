            <p>I spent a large portion of the day at work debugging an issue where I did not URL encode a Base64 encoded value I was sending to a server as a query parameter value.  I want to make sure I never waste time on this issue again.  I am writing a basic explanation of the problem and how to avoid it as reminder to myself.  I hope this may help some one else in the future too.</p>
            <p>Base64 encoded strings can contain the <code>+</code> character. If the <code>+</code> character is placed on a URL query parameter, it is interpreted as a space.  This is problematic because a space (<code> </code>) character is NOT a <code>+</code>. In fact, the space (<code> </code>) character is <b>not</b> a valid Base64 encoding character.</p>
            <p>To circumvent this behavior make sure you URL encode the Base64 encoded value so that <code>+</code> characters are encoded as <code>%2B</code>.</p>
            <p>For example, say I have to send <code>QUJD+REVG+0hJY=</code> to a server. If I put this on a URL <i>without</i> URL encoding the value, the URL will look like this: <code>http://simonkrueger.com?q=QUJD+REVG+0hJY=</code>. This URL is perfectly valid, but when a request with this URL is sent to a server the query parameter, <code>q</code>, is seen with a value of <code>QUJD REVG 0hJY=</code>. This is <i>not</i> what I wanted. Do you <i>see</i> those spaces? </p>
            <p>To fix this, I can URL encode this value <i>before</i> it is put on the URL. The URL now looks like this: <code>http://simonkrueger.com?q=QUJD%2BREVG%2B0hJY=</code>. Now the server sees <code>q</code>'s value as <code>QUJD+REVG+0hJY=</code>. Exactly what I wanted :).</p>
            <p>This is a pretty simple mistake that I am sure has been made a million times. I hope to not to make it a million and one. Anyway, always URL encode your <s>Base64 encoded</s> query parameters!</p>

            <p class="post-meta">Saturday, June 28th 2014</p>
            <p>I've updated the site's design today. I used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> to do most of the work. I've been in love with bootstrap ever since I learned about it a month ago. It provides tons of CSS components to easily arrange a website. It is so easy, part of me feels like I am cheating. If you haven't heard of it I highly recommend you check it out. It makes web site construction a joy.</p>

            <p class="post-meta">Wednesday, May 14th 2014</p>
            <p>Apparently this site has been down for over a year. The amazon EC2 instance that was running the server was shut down since February 2013. I restarted it with no problems and had the public key to login still on my box with putty configured properly.  Everything seems to be working pretty well. I got inspired to work on this again from watching a plural insight video. I will making more posts and start growing this site. I first need a better way to edit its content. I am not going to use wordpress or any other CMS. I'll come up with my own system that works well. Maybe just edit locally + SCP. We'll see.</p>
