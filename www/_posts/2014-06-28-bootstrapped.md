<h2 class="post-title">Bootstrapped</h2>
<p class="post-meta">Saturday, June 28th 2014</p>
<p>I've updated the site's design today. I used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> to do most of the work. I've been in love with bootstrap ever since I learned about it a month ago. It provides tons of CSS components to easily arrange a website. It is so easy, part of me feels like I am cheating. If you haven't heard of it I highly recommend you check it out. It makes web site construction a joy.</p>
