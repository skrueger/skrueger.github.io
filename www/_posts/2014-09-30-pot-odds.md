<h2 class="post-title">Pot odds</h2>

I went to Jad Abumrad's excellent talk on creativity at Benroya hall tonight and I was really interested when he talked about Pot Odds and applying it to every day life.
Pot odds is the concept poker players use to determine if they should make a bet or not.
For example, consider a play with a 25% chance of having the best hand. A probability of 25% is not very good.
However, when you there is a $300 pot and a $100 bet, the player should bet!
Why?
Because if the player places the bet and wins, they'll get $400. If they place the bet and lose, they'll lose $100.
If the player repeated this scenario indefinitely, they would get $400 every fourth time, which would be greater than the $300 they lost from the previous 3 bets.

Jad says he uses this strategy in his shows and his every day life. He uses it to determine if it is worth taking a risk on something. 
It also helps remind him that he does not always need to create a success.  I'm now curious how I can apply it to my own life.
