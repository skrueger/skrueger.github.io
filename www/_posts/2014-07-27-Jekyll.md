I changed the site this week to be generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and I couldn't be happier.
A friend of mine told me about it a few months ago.
It wasn't until I started growing this site did I see how awesome and useful it is.
It was very easy for me to port the site over to it.
It took me about an hour to learn and move everything over.
I'm very excited and I am looking forward to using it more.
